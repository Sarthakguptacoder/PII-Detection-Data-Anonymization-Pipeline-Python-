PII Detection & Data Anonymization Pipeline

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a *Python-based pipeline* to automatically detect and redact *Personally Identifiable Information (PII)* from structured datasets (CSV files).  
It ensures compliance with data privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) by *masking, substituting, or redacting sensitive fields* such as:

- Phone numbers  
- Aadhaar numbers  
- Passport numbers  
- UPI IDs  
- Email addresses  
- Postal addresses & PIN codes  
- Device IDs & IP addresses  

The output is a *redacted dataset* that can be safely used for analytics, ML model training, or data sharing without risking sensitive data exposure.
